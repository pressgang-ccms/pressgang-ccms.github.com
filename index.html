              <h3>Who needs PressGang CCMS?</h3>
              <p>Following are a few of the scenarios where PressGang CCMS may be the right solution.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Your documentation project currently uses Docbook XML in conjunction with command-line utilities, scripts, and revision control systems such as Subversion or Git</li>
                <li>You are currently managing your documentation using a word processor or expensive page-layout software, and want more control over the structure of your content without becoming an expert in XSLT, TeX, or other complicated technologies</li>
                <li>Your team is outgrowing its current Wiki, Markdown, or static HTML documentation solution</li>
                <li>You need better workflows for image and illustration management or localization</li>
              </ul>
