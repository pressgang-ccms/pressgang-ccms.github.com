              <h3>Who needs PressGang CCMS?</h3>
              <p>Following are a few of the scenarios where PressGang CCMS may be the right solution.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Your documentation project currently uses Docbook XML in conjunction with command-line utilities, scripts, and revision control systems such as Subversion or Git</li>
                <li>You are currently managing your documentation using a word processor or expensive page-layout software, and want more control over the structure of your content without becoming an expert in XSLT, TeX, or other complicated technologies</li>
                <li>Your team is outgrowing its current Wiki, Markdown, or static HTML documentation solution</li>
                <li>You need better workflows for image and illustration management or localization</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Who developed PressGang?</h3>
              <p>PressGang CCMS was founded as an internal startup project during the developement of JBoss EAP 6. Faced with creating an entirely new documentation suite, the team took the opportunity to create an entirely new way of authoring documentation. Built by technical writers, by technical writers.</p>
              <p>The original team consisted of <a href="https://github.com/mcasperson" target="_blank">Matthew Casperson</a>, Misty Stanley-Jones, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/davedri">David Ryan</a>, Tom Wells, and <a href="https://github.com/dmison" target="_blank">Darrin Mison</a>. Additional developers Lee Newson and <a href="https://github.com/codemiller" target="_blank">Katie Miller</a> were added as the project scaled rapidly across the organisation.</p>

              <h3>How do I build and deploy PressGang CCMS?</h3>
              <p>Due to internal challenges, a public build for PressGang CCMS was never officially made available or possible. Participating in a Startup Weekend, David Ryan built a public Amazon machine image based on a virtual machine image created in collaboration with Lee Newson. This experience encouraged further development, and has been forked into the <a href="http://www.corilla.co">Corilla</a> project.</p>

              <h3>How do I contribute?</h3>
              <p>The PressGang project is no longer being developed. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.corilla.co">Corilla</a> project.
              </p>

              <h3>Documentation</h3>
              <p>How many technical writers does it take to technical writer a user guide for their technical writing software?</p>

              <h3>Where can I find out more?</h3>
              <p>Road Map Bugs and RFEs are tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/page.cgi?id=browse.html&product=PressGang%20CCMS&product_version=&bug_status=open&tab=summary" target="_blank">Red Hat Bugzilla</a>. And again, refer to <a href="http://www.corilla.co">Corilla</a> for more information on the ongoing development of the project.</p>
