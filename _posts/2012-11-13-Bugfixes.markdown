I applied a minor bug fix release last night to the PressGang servers. Fixes are as follows:

<!-- MORE -->

 * Fixed the Double Login Issue. See BZ 867507
 * Fixed an issue where the Topic XML Editor wouldn't display when switching tabs.
 * Fixed an issue with pushing Translations to Zanata.
 * Fixed an issue where Converstions weren't being ended when an error was thrown.
* Fixed an issue where entering an invalid topic Id in the Quick Select box would just cause the page to reload. It now will display the  Angry Terminator.
 * Fixed an issue where the REST Server would throw an NPE when expanding LogDetails.
 * Fixed an issue where the Project Description Query parameter wouldn't work.
